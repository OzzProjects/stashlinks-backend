# StashLinks

Stash Links is chrome extension for users to save their visited sites and visit them once again. At times, when browsing online you may encounter a site that contains useful information but as a user you might not have the time to read through it all. Instead of, bookmarking the site on your browser, save the site with Stash Links in one place.

Ongoing: Stashlinks currently obtains the urls, sends them across an Heroku server application (PASS) and saves them in Postgres Database. The frontend is currently being developed
